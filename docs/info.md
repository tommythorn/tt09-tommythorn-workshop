## How it works

A Sigma-Delta PDM emits on `uo_out[1]`.  A UART listens for bytes (8N1 115,200 assuming clk is 50Â MHz)
and shifts that into the lower 8-bit of a 16-bit level.

## How to test

TBD: It is possible to drive bitbanged serial output from the onboard RP2020.  The PDM output can be observed
on a scope or filtered to get a smooth analogue signal.  It makes for a lousy DAC as at best you can update it
115,200/10/2 = 5760 times a second and the updates aren't atomic (thus will have artifacts).  It's just a
proof-of-concept.

## External hardware

Scope and/or analogue filter.
